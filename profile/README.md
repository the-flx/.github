# Welcome to the `the-flx` organization

The purpose of this organization is for me, **`@jcs090218`**, to rewrite the `flx` fuzzy matching algorithm in various programming languages.
Why, you ask? The reason is straightforward: I find flx to be an incredibly useful package with applications across different programming ecosystems.
From a practical standpoint, its implementation is compact enough to be easily shared with the public while also serving as an excellent way for me
to familiarize myself with different ecosystems. At the same time, it’s sufficiently complex to cover the fundamental syntax and features of various programming languages.

The original flx implemented in Elisp can be found at https://github.com/lewang/flx.
