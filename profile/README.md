# Welcome to the `the-flx` organization

The goal of this organization is for me **`@jcs090218`** to rewrite `flx` fuzzy matching algorithm in different programming languages.
But why is that? The reason is simple; I consider `flx` is a very useful package that you can always find the use cases
in different programming ecosystems. On the practical perspective, the implementation is small enough to publish to the public
(also I'm trying get use to the different ecosystems) and it's complex enough to learn most of the basic syntaxes in different programming langauges.

The original `flx` implemented in Elisp can be find in https://github.com/lewang/flx.
